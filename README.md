# SpawningComponent

this component makes a random number of boxes spawn in at random intervals. the minimum and maximum number of boxes spawning in can be adjusted, and the minimum and maximum waiting time between each spawn can be adjusted. the boxes will all spawn on the same Y level which can be freely adjusted or completely removed if needed. This relies on a prefeab for the box. the radius in which the boxes will spawn can also be adjusted, so that the boxes can be very spead out or really close together.
